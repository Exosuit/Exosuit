Some things about myself;

- I hate frontend but recently my friend introduced me to Chakra and I am now downbad for web slicing

- Stuntfighting as a hobby, I want to powerbomb whoever came up with whatever Fortinet kinda stuff

- Interested in backend stuff because of how I used to manage a game server to play with friends

- Want to create something that will help me maximize slacking quality
